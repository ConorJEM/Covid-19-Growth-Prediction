# Covid-19-Growth-Prediction
A project I completed back in May of 2020, predicting  COVID-19 case numbers and fatalities globally.

The project work was based off of a kaggle competition which can be found at link https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-2. My final private score was an RMSLE value of 0.91286 placing me within the top 50 submissions.

Note as part of my analysis into relevant factors of COVID-19's impact, datasets external to the kaggle competition were utilised. Links to each are provided within the jupyter notebook.

Note that the jupyter notebook doesn't contain just my model, but the whole process of my investigation into how to predict case and fatality numbers.
